The blog now has a new little icon, see below. It is generated using [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) using the prompt ``A video game icon in a dwaren style representing forbidden knowledge``. This icon is currently only used instead of the default website icon.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/icon.png" title="A Little Icon" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
