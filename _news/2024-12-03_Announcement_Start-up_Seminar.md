The start-up seminar for my PhD, where I will present my planned research for the faculty, has been scheduled to December 17th. During this seminar, the faculty will be able to give me peer feedback and engage in discussions around, or criticise, my planned work. It is all done so that I can give my plans another thought with a focus on an outside view which may otherwise be hard to get. After the seminar, I will have my first ISP review with my examiner. Title and abstract for the seminar can be found inside this announcement. Should the seminar be open for the public, a link for a Zoom-meeting will also be provided here at a later date.

**Title**
Leveling Up the Indie Scene: Automatic Play Testing and Quality Assurance
 
**Abstract**
An important, yet difficult and often overlooked, part of any game development endeavour is testing. From game play testing, wherein you ensure that your players react the way you expect to your product, to quality assurance, wherein you ensure that the game work and behaves as expected, testing is important to ensure that the finished product is up to par. Within the AAA games industry, automatic testing is under development and an active point of in-house research. Mainly done by either hard-coded agents in the game or different machine learning technologies that requires a lot of gameplay data and resources to train, these technologies can be hard to reuse by other actors in the game development space. How can the findings from the AAA developers be leveraged for development of technologies suitable for small-scale developers like the indie and hobbyist scene that dominates the Nordic game development scene? As a doctoral student within the project Game Tech Academy, that is what I have set out to uncover.
