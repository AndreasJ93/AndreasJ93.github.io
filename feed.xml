Looking back and reflecting over these years, I realize just how formative they have been. Here, I make an attempt at summarizing the experience I have had over these years.</p> <h1 id="courses">Courses</h1> <p>Over the years, I have had the good fortune to work with multiple courses at the university.

This course was offered to the third year game programming students and focused on understanding why physics are hard to get right in games – especially if one take into account the need for performance as well. The course was initially developed by Henrik Engström, who was also the examiner for the course.</p> <h1 id="theses">Theses</h1> <h1 id="view-on-research">View on Research</h1> <h1 id="view-on-pedagogy">View on Pedagogy</h1> <h1 id="union-commitment">Union Commitment</h1> <h1 id="safety-representative">Safety Representative</h1> <h1 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h1> <h1 id="finishing-words">Finishing Words</h1>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="University of Skövde"/><category term="Work"/><category term="University of Skövde"/><category term="Teaching"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today marks my final workday at the University of Skövde.
