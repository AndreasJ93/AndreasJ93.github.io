This January I am presenting a Positional Paper as part of the Doctoral course arranged by [Svenska Spelforskarr√•det](https://spelforskarradet.se/en/start-english/) (Council of Swedish Games Researchers). Want to read it? See the end of this post!

In many ways, this positional paper is the first time I have written anything ''formal'' regarding my thoughts and views on research -- in particular Game Research. It is an area I know contains many facets and differentiating opinions, and I feel like the paper I wrote contains a few points that I would have wanted to do more research around had this been for a conference or to be published more formally.

I do, however, believe that the paper touches upon one of the erroneous ways game research today is conducted within academia; the lack of understanding of the development context. Few projects, regardless of focus seems to be done within the actual constraints of a game development company. It does not matter if the constraints are financial ones or, as for instance in the area of Game AI, computational time allowed and fidelity required -- I rarely see these kept in mind as the research is conducted. This, in my humble opinion, causes a rift between academia and industry, wherein the produce and knowledge generation of the former are all but useless for the later.

Want to understand what I mean? Please, do read the paper below!
