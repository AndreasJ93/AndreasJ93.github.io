Today marks my final workday at the University of Skövde. I have worked here for almost five years, and I believe that a summarization is in order.

# Introduction
The first of January 2020, mere months before the Covid-19 pandemic hit Sweden, my work at the University of Skövde begun after a year and a half at Blekinge Institute of Technology where I worked after my studies. Looking back and reflecting over these years, I realize just how formative they have been. Here, I make an attempt at summarizing the experience I have had over these years.

# Courses
Over the years, I have had the good fortune to work with multiple courses at the university. This work has ranged from taking over courses that has been running smoothly for years to create completely new courses. 

## Game Physics
> If the students understands why the physics part of the game engine is hard to get right, then they understand the course.

One of my first tasks at the University of Skövde was to take over and run the course Game Physics. This course was offered to the third year game programming students and focused on understanding why physics are hard to get right in games – especially if one take into account the need for performance as well. The course was initially developed by Henrik Engström, who was also the examiner for the course, and was only to be given two more times before being phased out from the program. As the course was to be given in the autumn, I had almost half a year to make myself familiar with the content and update it where necessary. 

This was at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and I realized that, come autumn, we risked seeing an upswing in infected again. As I needed to read up on and understand the material anyway, I decided to completely change how the material was to be presented to the students. Instead of holding traditiona two-hours lectures, I divided the material into 16 categories, all but one containing between two and eight short lectures. Each lecture was a video recording, about five minutes long, presenting and explaining a concept relevant for the understanding of game physics. All in all, I recorded just shy of 85 video lectures for this course. As a complement to these video lectures there were weekly seminars for which the students could submit questions or ask for clarifications for concepts they had encountered in the material. Runnable simulations, with code, were also provided for the course. These I worked with translating from the original C++ implementation in a framework created by Prof. Engström to Unity, as this was the environment the students were used to. 

For assignments I kept the original course assignment as they were – five short group projects and one bigger individual work. The shorter group projects were divided into real-world and simulation assignments. These were to be presented as a video for the real-world assignments or as an executable for the simulation ones. These were shown during a seminar and the students were encouraged to discuss each other's solutions. Common errors were compiled and presented as extra material for the student group. The indidvidual work ran alongside these group works. Here, the students chose a physic phenomena to simulate and write a report about. To support the students in the report writing, a necessarity due to the lack of training through the programe, a writing guide was compiled and given to the students. 

## Game Projects
> Working together is hard, even if everyone speaks the same language. Working together in a transdisciplinary project? Well, you got a lot to learn, kid.

During my first year at Skövde, one of my colleagues left for a job within QA at Paradox Interactive. Being relatively free with a lot of hours to find work for, I was thrown into the world of Game Project courses as course responsible together with another colleague. While Skövde have had game project courses since the programs started, this was an entirely new iteration of courses. More importantly, there were now three of them. As I worked with my colleague to understand this course, I also realized that the following two courses were not even in development yet. As such, I proposed to change that and took a hollistic approach to creating the courses Game Project 2 and Game Project 3. At the same time, my colleague and I changed a lot of the core in Game Project 1 based on our own and students' reflections.

This work was very rewarding, but also very draining. It started with gathering information, allowing me as an outsider to finally get a glimpse of not only the history of game development that exists in Skövde, but also interviewing and listen in to staff at the department and former students. I conducted interviews, tried to understand how my colleagues saw these courses – whether they had worked in them or not was irrelevant. I listened to the professionals from the industry around us, and read through research regarding game project courses around the world, transdiciplinary courses around the world, as well as game development reports and books. With all this in mind, I started compiling rough drafts for the two courses, using two colleagues for discussions, and presented it for the programme co-ordinators. After taking their responses and compiled it, tweaking the courses, I presented it for the department before they were adopted.

I knew that these courses would not be entirely what students, or colleagues, expected. My aim was to give students the tools to succeed in the industry, to differentiate themselves from the students that had passed a higher vocational education programme. What I got was a... reputation. Below, I present the courses as they were. Please note that they have changed since, as other colleagues took over during the autumn of 2023.

### Game Project 1
**Goal:** The goal of Game Project 1 was to introduce students not only to game development, but to each others' disciplines – to create an understanding of the context they worked within.

The Game Project 1 course started of with three intensive weeks. Each week, the students had one inspirational lecture (held by a researcher at the department) on Monday, a few study-oriented lectures (held by the pedagogic coordinator, the library, and the student health service), two disciplin lectures on Tuesday and Thursday, and two assessed workshops on Wednesday and Friday, corresponding to the lectures. Before the workshops, the students had study material to go through in preparation as well as a video guide to guide them through setting up the environment for the workshop. During the actual workshops, the students were divided into groups, where they also met the students they would work with in the second part of the course. Besides the programming workshop (because programming is always a daunting task), this module was mostly met with gratitude from the students – many finding it helpful for the second part of the course.

During the second half of the course the students were working in small groups of four to five students to modify an existing experience – one of Unity's available [Microgames](https://assetstore.unity.com/search#q=microgames). The goal was to work together, using the knowledge they had gathered in the previous Module, to create a game experience of their own. Here, the students were not expected to work with their own discipline but rather help each other to make their shared vision come to life. Every week the students had assessed meetings with an assigned mentor, at the end of the course they had an assessed individual conversation with their mentor, and lastly they were required to write an individual report regarding their work. During the course, one assessed game testing session – where the students were assessed on attendance – was conducted.

**End result:** In the end, Game Project 1 was a quite smooth operation. It was intensive for staff and students alike, but it was rewarding work seeing what the students could come up with!


### Game Project 2
**Goal:** The goal of Game Project 2 was to make the students, who now were halfway through their education, understand how the work they conducted as part of their disciplinary work affected other disciplines – as well as understand how other disciplines work affected them.

Game Project 2 started of with two very intensive weeks. The students were divided into groups of around ten students, each group recieveing a mentor. During the first two weeks they were to create multiple physical game prototypes, narrowing it down to two prototypes that they game tested on each other, and implement a first iteration of the prototype as a digital product. Alongside this were seminars regarding power and leadership in a project group as well as societal and ethical aspects of game development. The students really raised to the challenge – even if most of them do not agree on this! During these weeks, the students were assessed on participitating in seminars and during meetings with the mentor.

The rest of the course was to implement this game properly – creating a product the group would be satisfied with. Every week the students had meetings with their mentor, and three times over the course there were game testing sessions planned – two internal only and one where we invited the game industry professionals from around Skövde. The course itself was assessed in three ways – participitation during the meetings with the mentor and the game tests, a poster seminar where the focus was on the game and group work, as well as a poster seminar where the focus was on each students' own disciplinary work and how it affected the group at large.

**End result:** In the end, quite a few things were left to do with Game Project 2. In my mind this course is, and will always be, the course that was never truely conducted – indeed, it was always something that made it less of what it was supposed to be.

### Game Project 3
**Goal:** The goal of Game Project 3 was for each student to shine. As the last course, it was meant to faciliate showcasing of each students' ability and prowess within their field – allowing them to hone in on a single component they had created as part of the game they had developed within the group.

Game Project 3. I am torn between calling this my greatest failure or my greatest success. The idea was simple enough – faciliate a course where the students can do anything they wish, while still being assessed in a way reflecting the last course of a higher education. For this course, the students had absolute and total freedom. They could work in pre-defined groups, seek internship within a game company, do a solo project, be placed in groups with other students who had not created groups themselves... There were no limits to how they were allowed to work or who they worked with. We even had Science Park Skövde introduce a "pre-pre-incubation step" wherein the students could get tips from the park's buisness coached during the course itself. However, the devil is in the details. And for this course, the detail was the project portfolio.

The idea behind the project portfolio was simple enough. Pick something, anything, that you created as part of the game your group worked on and present it in greater detail. It could be anything from a simple 3D prop to a complex networking solution — all driven by the student's discipline and what they had worked with in the game. The chosen component was then to be described in a project portfolio consisting of five shorter texts:
1. Sources and Inspirations
   * In this text, the student were required to present what sources (at least one academical and one industrial) as well as inspirations they had used when working with the project component and the game
   * It was a requirement to present all sources that were relevant for the next four texts
   * Moreover, the students were required to describe how they had worked while finding this material 
2. Context
   * This text focused on the transdisciplinary context of the group, with a focus on things that affected the project component directly
   * They were also required to present the planing and execution to reach project goals that were relevant for the project component
3. The Project Component
   * Simply put, here the project component itself was presented. What is it, how does it fit into the game, and why was it chosen as the component to focus on?
4. Societal and Ethical Aspects
   * Here, the students were free to pick aspects to focus on. It could be anything from the group composition to problematic themes potraied in the game
   * More importantly, it could be a reflective text, looking back at things that were missed during the course of the project.
5. The Work Process
   * For the last text, the students were expected to describe the work process. How had they planned their work, did everything go as planned? How did they handle change? 
   * They were also encouraged to present what important decisions they had taken and what they based them on
   * Lastly, it was encouraged to talk about how the work had affected other students in the group

These texts were expected to be self-standing. That is to say, they should not require the reader to have read any of the other texts to understand the one they read now. Each text was required to be at most five pages, not including references, pictures, tables, or other media. To support the students with this work, a lot of the teachers' hours were spent in a classroom where we divided the students in groups and had tailored excercises every week. These classes were not mandatory, and after a few weeks there were only a few students left attending them. We also had assessed presentations throughout the course to make sure that the students presented something along the way and did not forget working on the portfolio.

At the end of the course we held an open expo, wherein the students presented their component and the work with it inside different classrooms, while the games were presented outside for anyone to witness.

**End result:** Game Project 3 was a course I only held once before leaving it over to colleagues. In many way, shapes, and forms I am personally happy with this course and I know that it could be more than it became, had I had the time to shape it more. Unfortunately, this course was stained with feelings from the students that had accummulated over the years before.
