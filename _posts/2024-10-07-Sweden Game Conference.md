Last week, I attended Sweden Game Conference 2024. It was not my first time, neither do I believe it was my last. Here, I have collected my thoughts and experiences.

[Sweden Game Conference](https://swedengameconference.se/en/) is held yearly in Skövde, Sweden. It is a conference aimed at the industry, with a close connection to [University of Skövde](https://his.se/en) and the [Skövde Municipality](https://skovde.se), with talks, panels, pitch events, and more. For the students at the University of Skövde, there are also the opportunity to win the [SAGA award](https://skovde.se/naringsliv-arbete/Naringslivet-i-Skovde/skovde-academic-game-award/). For teachers and educators in Game Development, the [Council of Swedish Game Researchers](https://spelforskarradet.se/en/start-english/)(Svenska Spelforskarrådet) hosts the Game Educator Summit.

During my time at the University of Skövde, especially while course responsible for the Game Project courses, this conference was one I regularly attended. It was a great way to meet students, both current and former, engage in the local and national game development community, as well as to keep oneself updated with the current topics of the game industry -- all without leaving Skövde! I have attended every Game Educator Summit -- even presented on the topic of Generative AI last year -- since its incarnation in 2021. 2021 was also the year I attended the conference for the first time. 

This year I got to see the conference through other eyes. The key note, A roadmap to the AI revolution in games, made me feel like the area of my PhD was one filled with possibilities. That the key note was held by one of my personal research heroes, [Julian Togelius](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/julian-togelius) (currently a guest professor at University of Skövde), _and_ that I had the great pleasure of not only discussing my PhD plans with him over lunch but also take a stroll and discuss a potential project, enhanced the feeling. Following these discussions, I see new possible paths for how to develop this PhD -- which I will discuss with my supervisors tomorrow.

During the conference I also attended some great talks -- many of which gave me new ideas or insights in how tools and systems are actually used by the developers. Jonathan Smårs from Iron Gate, creators of Valheim, talked about the PCG system that build the world for this game, as well as how to use just the right amount of tools (and how to know what tools to develop for others to use). Arvi Teikari, creator of Baba is You, talked about the development of the formentioned game -- including both design and buisness decisions. Filippa Arvidsson from Stunlock Studios, most recently known for V Rising, presented the importance of tools for small teams -- a talk that really put a perspective on how the slightest change can be of importance. Lastly, I attended the panel regarding automatic tools -- hosted by the always amazing Dennis Karugu -- which gave me an insight in challenges lying ahead.

As tradition holds, the last thing on the agenda was SUP (SpelUtvecklar Pub, GameDeveloper Pub). A few beers and reconnecting with students and game developers in a more laid-back environment -- what more could one ask for?

Last, but not least, this year's conference also had a very special event; the unveiling of Skövde's Walk of Games. While I was unable to attend the unveiling myself, I have since walked the street and looked at the plaques celebrating the biggest releases out of Skövde. If you wish to read more about the Walk of Games, David Hollingsworth at ESTNN made an article that you can read [here](https://estnn.com/skovde-walk-of-game-a-small-city-with-big-idea/).
