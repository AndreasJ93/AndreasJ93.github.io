The 17th of January I presented at my Start-Up Seminar. In this post, you can not only read my thoughts about the seminar, but also the presentation itself.

The presentation was conducted in a small room at Malm√∂ University with an audience consisting of my three supervisors, my examiner, and a few members of the faculty that were interested in hearing my plans for the research project. Most importantly for me, both my wife and son were present; giving me a well-needed boost of confidence. Through Zoom, members of the Game Tech Academy project were welcomed to join.

The presentation went smoothly and I managed to hold the time without any hitches. After some feedback and questions from my examiner -- which I do hope I managed to answer in a satisfying manner -- the floor was opened for the faculty. 

All in all, I believe that I gave a proper view of my plans going forth and managed to clear out any questions. With my ISP (individual study plan) approved, it is time to start properly working on this research!
